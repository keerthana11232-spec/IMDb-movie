The IMDb Movie Rating Scraper is a Python-based automation project that collects movie rating data directly from IMDb. The program uses web scraping techniques (Selenium and/or BeautifulSoup) to extract key information such as movie titles, IMDb ratings, release year, and ranking from the IMDb Top 250 list or specific movie pages.
